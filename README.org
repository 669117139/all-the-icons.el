#+STARTUP: showall

** Installation

You should be able to install this package in the standard way, add it
to the load path and then calling

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'all-the-icons)
;; or
(use-package all-the-icons)
#+END_SRC

However, in order for the icons to work you will need to install the
Resource Fonts included in this package, they are available in the
~fonts~ directory.

** Usage

The simplest usage for this package is to use the following functions;

+ ~ati-icon-for-buffer~
+ ~ati-icon-for-file~
+ ~ati-icon-for-mode~

Which can be used to get a formatted icon which you can insert into
buffers, /e.g./

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(insert (ati-icon-for-file "foo.js"))
;; will insert #("î¤…" 0 1 (display (raise -0.24) face (:family "dev-icons" :height 1.08 :foreground "#FFD446" :icon "javascript")))
#+END_SRC

*** Inserting Icons Directly

The above is fine if you want this package to automatically decide on
the icon you want for files and things, however, to insert the icons
directly you will want to use these icons functions;

+ ~ati/alltheicon~
+ ~ati/devicon~
+ ~ati/faicon~
+ ~ati/fileicon~
+ ~ati/oction~
+ ~ati/wicon~

You can then call these functions with the icon you want to insert,
/e.g./

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(ati/octicon "file-binary")  ;; GitHub Octicon for Binary File
(ati/faicon  "cogs")         ;; FontAwesome icon for cogs
(ati/wicon   "tornado")      ;; Weather Icon for tornado
#+END_SRC

A list of all the icon names for a font family can be found in the
~data~ directory, or by inspecting the alist variables.

The alist variables are all prefixed with 

+ ~ati-data/~

For example ~C-h v ati-data/ <TAB>~ will give a list of all the data
alist you can describe /(and the icon fonts they're associated with)/

*** Propertizing icons yourself

However, sometimes when propertizing these icons /(for example
if you were customising your mode line)/ you /may/ sometimes have
to know the font family to add in, /e.g./

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (propertize (ati/octicon "package")
              'face `(:family "github-octicons" :height 1.2)
              'display '(raise -0.1))
#+END_SRC
